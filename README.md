## T-SQL Formatter

A free, open-source library for formatting T-SQL code, with support for SSMS integration, command-line usage, and various other tools.

> **Based on Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter by Tao Klerks**
> This project is a continuation and modernization of the original Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter, maintaining full attribution to the original author and all contributors while updating the architecture for modern development.

### Project Structure (2025 Refactor)

The project has been restructured into a modern, maintainable architecture:

* **TSqlFormatter.Core** - Core .NET 4.7.2 library containing all formatting logic
  * Tokenization and parsing engine
  * Multiple formatter implementations (Standard, Identity, Obfuscating)
  * Thread-safe node implementation for concurrent usage
  * Configurable formatting options

* **TSqlFormatter.SSMS** - SSMS 21 extension package
  * Full Options dialog for configuration
  * Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F)
  * Persistent settings via Visual Studio settings store

### Current Solution

* **TSqlFormatter.SSMS21.sln** - Main solution file with streamlined 2-project structure

### Building the Solution

#### Prerequisites:
* Visual Studio 2019 or later
* .NET Framework 4.7.2
* VSSDK (Visual Studio SDK) for building VSIX packages

#### Build Commands:
```bash
# Build the new streamlined SSMS 21 solution
msbuild TSqlFormatter.SSMS21.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"

# Or restore packages first if needed
msbuild /t:Restore TSqlFormatter.SSMS21.sln
msbuild TSqlFormatter.SSMS21.sln /p:Configuration=Release

# The VSIX package will be created at:
# TSqlFormatter.SSMS\bin\Release\TSqlFormatter.SSMS.vsix
```

### Installing in SSMS

1. Close all instances of SSMS
2. Double-click the generated `TSqlFormatter.SSMS.vsix` file
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Restart SSMS
5. Access the formatter via:
   - **Tools > Format T-SQL Code** (or Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F)
   - **Tools > T-SQL Formatter Options...** for settings

### Features

* **Core Formatting Engine**
  * Simple XML-style parse tree for SQL structure representation
  * Extensible architecture supporting multiple SQL dialects
  * Thread-safe implementation for concurrent formatting operations
  * Fault-tolerant parsing - handles unknown constructs gracefully

* **Formatting Options**
  * **Indentation**: Tabs or spaces with configurable width
  * **Line Width Control**: Maximum line length (50-999 characters)
  * **List Formatting**: Expand comma lists, IN lists with various styles
  * **Expression Formatting**: Boolean expressions, CASE statements, BETWEEN conditions
  * **JOIN Formatting**: Break at ON clauses
  * **Keyword Formatting**: Uppercase and standardization options
  * **Line Breaks**: Control blank lines between clauses and statements

* **Output Formats**
  * Standard formatted T-SQL
  * Colorized HTML output
  * Obfuscated SQL (for demos/examples)

* **Capabilities**
  * Handles complete T-SQL including procedural code
  * Formats entire batches and multi-batch scripts
  * Preserves comments and special formatting where possible
  * Fast performance - processes large codebases efficiently


### General Limitations

* This is NOT a full SQL-parsing solution: only "coarse" parsing is performed, the 
    minimum necessary for re-formatting.
* The standard formatter does not always maintain the order of comments in the code;
    a comment inside an "INNER JOIN" compound keyword, like "inner/\*test\*/join", would
    get moved out, to "INNER JOIN /\*test\*/". The original data is maintaned in the 
    parse tree, but the standard formatter shuffles comments in cases like this for 
    clarity.
* DDL parsing, in particular, is VERY coarse - the bare minimum to display ordered table 
    column and procedure parameter declarations.
* No effort has been made to support compatibility level 70 (SQL Server 7)
* Where there is ambiguity between different compatibility levels (eg cross apply 
    parens in compatibility level 90 vs table hints without "WITH" keyword in 
    compatibility level 80), no approach has been decided. For now, table hints 
    without WITH are considered to be arguments to a function.
* Settings may not be correctly maintained across major upgrades of SSMS and Visual Studio
 

### Known Issues / Todo

* Handling of DDL Triggers (eg "FOR LOGON")
* Formatting/indenting of ranking functions
* FxCop checking
* And other stuff that is tracked in the GitHub issues list


### Longer-term enhancements / additions

* Compiled mono library + bulk formatting tool download (eg for use on SVN server)
* Documentation of Xml structure and class usage
    * Keeping track of versioning and documentation more carefully: http://semver.org/
